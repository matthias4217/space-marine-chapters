# Attributes

Each chapter has the following attributes. Apart of the name, they are all optional.

## Name

The name of the warband. Itâ€™s still not clear if it should be the current (M41) name, the founding name, or something else.
Find more about this issue [there](https://github.com/matthias4217/space-marine-chapters/issues/1).

Many Chaos warbands do not have such an attribute.
This can be :
* An integer, for the number of the founding

* `Ultima`, for the [Ultima founding](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Founding#Ultima_Founding)

## Legion

Boolean, True if it was part of the twenty original legions, else False.

## Homebrew

Boolean, True if this is not an official chapter, else False.
The main CSV file only features official chapters, but I have included exemples of homebrew chapters.
