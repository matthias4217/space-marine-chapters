# Attributes

Each chapter has the following attributes. Apart of the name, they are all optional.

## Name

The name of the warband. Itâ€™s still not clear if it should be the current (M41) name, the founding name, or something else.

Boolean, True if this is not an official chapter, else False.
The main CSV file only features official chapters, but I have included exemples of homebrew chapters.
